# Adventure Works Data Analysis Project üìä
<br>

## Overview  

This repository contains a data analysis project based on the Adventure Works dataset provided by Microsoft. <br>
The focus of this analysis is on the Internet Sales schema. <br>
We‚Äôll explore the data, perform data cleansing and transformation using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), save the results in CSV format, and create visualizations using Power BI.

### Dataset  üìÅ
Adventure Works is a sample database provided by Microsoft for learning and practice.<br>
It is a huge dataset with many tables but for this project, we are analysing the Internet Sales only.
The dataset includes information related to sales, products, customers etc.<br>

## Tools Used  üõ†Ô∏è
    SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS):
    - Used for data cleansing, transformation, and querying.
    - Performed tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and aggregating data.
    Power BI:
    - Imported the cleaned data from CSV files.
    - Power Query for more data transformations.
    - Created visualizations (charts, tables, etc.) to gain insights.

## Data Preparation  üîÑ
The data preparation process involved the following steps:
- Data Extraction: Using SQL queries in SSMS, the relevant data from the Internet Sales schema was extracted.
- Data Cleansing: Various data cleansing techniques were applied to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.
- Data Transformation: Necessary transformations were performed to restructure the data, create calculated columns, and derive new metrics.
- Data Export: The cleaned and transformed data was exported as CSV files for further analysis in Power BI.
- Power Query: In Power BI, additional data transformation steps were applied using Power Query to ensure the data was ready for visualization and analysis.
  
## Visualization and Analysis  üìà
The final step of the project involved creating visualizations and performing analysis in Power BI. The following tasks were accomplished:
- Data Modeling: The imported data was modeled effectively to establish relationships between different tables and enable seamless analysis.
- Visualization Creation: Various visualizations, such as charts, graphs, maps, and tables, were created to represent key metrics and uncover insights from the data.
- Dashboard Development: Interactive dashboards were developed to provide a comprehensive view of the Internet Sales data, enabling easy exploration and analysis.
- Analysis and Insights: Through the visualizations and dashboards, valuable insights were derived, including sales trends, customer behavior, product performance, and geographic distribution of sales.

## Key Findings üîç

- Sales Overview: Visualized sales trends over time and identified top profit making areas.
- Customer Behavior: Explored customer demographics and purchasing patterns.
- Product Insights: Analyzed product performance and profitability metrics.
