## Recommendations
The analysis underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and evaluation of the loan portfolio. <br>
We recommend the following actions:

    Enhanced Risk Assessment: Implementing more rigorous credit scoring models to predict loan performance.
    Strategic Loan Structuring: Tailoring loan terms to balance profitability with risk.
    Dynamic Portfolio Management: Regularly updating lending strategies based on real-time data analysis.
