## üìÅ [And more..](https://github.com/din3shn/DA_Portfolio_Proj/tree/main/Excel_Projects_and_More/More_Excel)

This repository contains all the other mini files which demonstrate skills. These are not full projects nor do they have any specific goal.<br>
These files are the demonstration of various formulas and other skills I have gained during my learning process. <br>
Some Workbooks have multiple sheets which are named according to the operations/ skills/ formulas used in the said sheet.<br>
This showscases the skills which could not be used in the projects I have made because of the nature of the dataset and the types of analysis performed but these files have all the important skills needed for Data Analysis.
