# Welcome to My Portfolio.


- Hi, I'm Dinesh.
- I'm a new data analyst learning the process.
- Take a look at some of the projects I've been working on while learning.
- Projects are based on SQL, Excel, PowerBI etc.

    ## SQL
- [Data Cleansing and Exploration](https://github.com/din3shn/DA_Portfolio_Proj/tree/main/SQL_DataMart_Project) .

    - This SQL project focuses on the analysis of sales data from a retail store over a specific period of time.
    - The dataset contains information about the storeâ€™s sales activities across different platforms and customer segments.
    - The starting steps involve Data Cleansing to simplify the analysis process.
    - The next steps showcase analysis of the data based on a few questions.
